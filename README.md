ImageSource is an image abstraction. It is intended to represent an image that can come from many different sources.

Some examples of the sources are:
* file system (`LocalImageSource`)
* network (`RemoteImageSource`)
* user's photo library (`PHAssetImageSource`)

It allows you to retrieve the actual bitmap in a simple and efficient way using the unified API and supports retrieval cancellation.
It is also designed to be platform-independent, so you can use it both on iOS and macOS.

## <a name="installation" />Installation
### <a name="installation-cocoapods" />CocoaPods

To integrate ImageSource into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'ImageSource'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### <a name="installation-spm" />Swift Package Manager
```swift
let package = Package(
    // 4.0.0 
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/avito-tech/ImageSource.git", from: "4.0.0")
    ],
    // ...
)
```

## <a name="use-cases" />Typical use cases
### <a name="displaying-in-ui" />Displaying in UI
To present `ImageSource` in `UIImageView`, you should use extension method that comes with `ImageSource/UIKit` pod:

```swift
func setImage(
    fromSource: ImageSource?,
    size: CGSize? = nil,
    placeholder: UIImage? = nil,
    placeholderDeferred: Bool = false,
    adjustOptions: ((_ options: inout ImageRequestOptions) -> ())? = nil,
    resultHandler: ((ImageRequestResult<UIImage>) -> ())? = nil)
    -> ImageRequestId?
```

In most cases, however, you would want to just use its simplest version, passing only the first parameter:

`imageView.setImage(fromSource: imageSource)`

### <a name="getting-image-data" />Getting image data
To get image data use `ImageSource.fullResolutionImageData(completion:)`:

```swift
imageSource.fullResolutionImageData { data in
    try? data?.write(to: fileUrl)
}
```

### <a name="getting-image-size" />Getting image size
To get image size use `ImageSource.imageSize(completion:)`:

```swift
imageSource.imageSize { size in
    // do something with size
}
```
